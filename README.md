# Daniel's Portfolio
This is a portfolio of my work as a full stack developer. It includes a variety of projects that I have worked on, including both personal projects and projects that I have worked on as part of a team. The portfolio is divided into sections such as experience, education, and skills. Each section includes a brief description of its contents, as well as links to the projects that I have worked on (if public).
